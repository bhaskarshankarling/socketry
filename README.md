High-level Ruby socket library with support for TCP, UDP, and SSL sockets.

Implements thread-safe timeouts using asynchronous I/O and high-precision monotonic timers.

## Motivation

By default, Ruby sockets do not provide a built-in timeout mechanism. The only
timeout mechanism provided by the language leverages [timeout.rb], which uses
[unsafe multithreaded behaviors] to implement timeouts.

While Socketry provides a synchronous, blocking API similar to Ruby's own
`TCPSocket` and `UDPSocket` classes, behind the scenes it uses non-blocking I/O
to implement thread-safe timeouts.

[timeout.rb]: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/timeout/rdoc/Timeout.html
[unsafe multithreaded behaviors]: http://blog.headius.com/2008/02/ruby-threadraise-threadkill-timeoutrb.html

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "socketry"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install socketry

## Basic Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use Socketry to make an HTTPS request:

```ruby
require "socketry"

socket = Socketry::SSL::Socket.connect("github.com", 443)
socket.writepartial("GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: github.com\r\n\r\n")
p socket.readpartial(1024)
```

[TCP], [SSL], and [UDP] servers and sockets also available.

[SSL]: https://github.com/socketry/socketry/wiki/SSL
[UDP]: https://github.com/socketry/socketry/wiki/UDP

## Documentation

[Please see the Socketry wiki](https://github.com/socketry/socketry/wiki)
for more detailed documentation and usage notes.

[YARD API documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/socketry/)
is also available.

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
versions:

* Ruby 2.2.6+
* Ruby 2.3
* Ruby 2.4
* Ruby 2.5
* JRuby 9.1.6.0+

If something doesn't work on one of these versions, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby versions,
however support will only be provided for the versions listed above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version or
implementation, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer
entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When
something breaks on your implementation, you will be responsible for providing
patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation
exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be
dropped.
